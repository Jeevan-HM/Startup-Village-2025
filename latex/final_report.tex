\subsection*{PURPOSE OF INSPECTION}
A real estate inspection is a visual survey of a structure and a basic performance evaluation of the systems and components of a building. It provides information regarding the general condition of a residence at the time the inspection was conducted.

It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information. Ask the inspector to clarify any items or comments that are unclear.

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSPECTOR}
This inspection is governed by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) Standards of Practice (SOPs), which dictates the minimum requirements for a real estate inspection.

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item use this Property Inspection Report form for the inspection;
\item inspect only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at the time of the inspection;
\item indicate whether each item was inspected, not inspected, or not present;
\item indicate an item as Deficient (D) if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a system or component OR constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the SOPs; and
\item explain the inspector's findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS NOT required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item identify all potential hazards;
\item turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utilities, or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance;
\item climb over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items;
\item prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another;
\item provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs have been made; or
\item inspect system or component listed under the optional section of the SOPs (22 TAC 535.233).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLIENT}
While items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions, in the event that any further evaluations are needed, it is the responsibility of the client to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service professionals regarding any items reported as Deficient (D). It is recommended that any further evaluations and/or cost estimates take place prior to the expiration of any contractual time limitations, such as option periods.

\noindent\textbf{Please Note:} Evaluations performed by service professionals in response to items reported as Deficient (D) on the report may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies that were not present, visible, or accessible at the time of the inspection. Any repairs made after the date of the inspection may render information contained in this report obsolete or invalid.

\section*{\centering I. INSPECTION REPORT OVERVIEW}

\subsection*{A. Report Context}

Please be advised that infrared thermal imaging may be utilized to assess specific areas or systems for potential anomalies. Any indications observed through thermal imaging are always corroborated by supplementary methods, such as a moisture meter, to confirm their presence. The effectiveness of infrared thermography in detecting moisture is contingent upon the actual presence of moisture; therefore, during dry periods, a leak may exist but remain undetectable if the affected materials are devoid of moisture. It is crucial to understand that thermal imaging does not function as X-ray vision, cannot penetrate solid surfaces, and is not capable of identifying mold.\\

This home inspection constitutes a non-intrusive, visual assessment of the readily accessible portions of the property. Its purpose is to identify significant concerns within specific systems or components as observed and deemed relevant by the inspector at the precise date and time of the inspection. All recommendations pertaining to repair, replacement, further evaluation, or maintenance should be reviewed by qualified trade professionals within your contractual contingency period or prior to the closing date, as applicable. This is essential for obtaining accurate cost estimates for any necessary work and recognizing that these expert evaluations may uncover additional issues beyond what is discernible during a purely visual inspection. This report will not encompass every conceivable issue or defect present but focuses solely on material deficiencies that were visible on the day of the assessment. The inspection aims solely to aid in evaluating the general condition of the residence. It does not forecast future conditions, and the property\&apos;s state may evolve immediately following our departure. Inspectors are not obligated to relocate personal belongings, access panels, furnishings, equipment, vegetation, earth, snow, ice, or any obstructions that impede access or visibility.\\

It is advisable to review the established Standards of Practice for a comprehensive understanding of the inspection\&apos;s scope.
The findings in this report reflect the observable condition of the property\&apos;s accessible areas solely on the inspection date. The state of components can fluctuate between the inspection date and the date of title transfer. A comprehensive final walkthrough before closing is strongly advised to mitigate unforeseen issues. Acquiring a home warranty is also recommended, particularly if certain systems are approaching or have exceeded their expected lifespan.
Notice to Third Parties: This document is the proprietary information of the inspection company and is exclusively for the client(s) named herein. It is not transferable to any other parties or future purchasers. This inspection and report are conducted under a specific contractual agreement that defines its scope and utility. Therefore, any unauthorized individuals or entities are cautioned against relying on this report and should instead engage their own qualified property inspector to obtain an independent assessment.
Copyright Notice: This report is the intellectual property of the inspection firm. The client(s) and their designated real estate representative mentioned herein are the sole authorized licensees of this document. This report, in its entirety or in part, is strictly non-transferable to any third parties, including but not limited to subsequent buyers, sellers, or listing agents. The reproduction of identified deficiencies for the purpose of preparing repair requests is permissible. THE CONTENTS OF THIS REPORT ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR THE RELIANCE OF THE CLIENT NAMED HEREIN. This report is subject to an inspection agreement that outlines its scope, limitations, exclusions, and copyright terms. Unapproved recipients are advised to commission a separate inspection from a qualified professional of their choosing.
For clarity within this report, all directional references such as left, right, rear, and front are established from the perspective of facing the primary entrance of the structure, as illustrated in the cover photograph.\\

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{PURPOSE OF INSPECTION}
A real estate inspection is a visual survey of a structure and a basic performance evaluation of the systems and components of a building. It provides information regarding the general condition of a residence at the time the inspection was conducted.

It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information. Ask the inspector to clarify any items or comments that are unclear.

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSPECTOR}
This inspection is governed by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) Standards of Practice (SOPs), which dictates the minimum requirements for a real estate inspection.

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item use this Property Inspection Report form for the inspection;
\item inspect only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at the time of the inspection;
\item indicate whether each item was inspected, not inspected, or not present;
\item indicate an item as Deficient (D) if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a system or component OR constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the SOPs; and
\item explain the inspector's findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS NOT required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item identify all potential hazards;
\item turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utilities, or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance;
\item climb over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items;
\item prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another;
\item provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs have been made; or
\item inspect system or component listed under the optional section of the SOPs (22 TAC 535.233).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLIENT}
While items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions, in the event that any further evaluations are needed, it is the responsibility of the client to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service professionals regarding any items reported as Deficient (D). It is recommended that any further evaluations and/or cost estimates take place prior to the expiration of any contractual time limitations, such as option periods.

\noindent\textbf{Please Note:} Evaluations performed by service professionals in response to items reported as Deficient (D) on the report may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies that were not present, visible, or accessible at the time of the inspection. Any repairs made after the date of the inspection may render information contained in this report obsolete or invalid.

\section*{\centering I. INSPECTION REPORT OVERVIEW}

\subsection*{A. Report Context}

Please be advised that infrared thermal imaging may be utilized to assess specific areas or systems for potential anomalies. Any indications observed through thermal imaging are always corroborated by supplementary methods, such as a moisture meter, to confirm their presence. The effectiveness of infrared thermography in detecting moisture is contingent upon the actual presence of moisture; therefore, during dry periods, a leak may exist but remain undetectable if the affected materials are devoid of moisture. It is crucial to understand that thermal imaging does not function as X-ray vision, cannot penetrate solid surfaces, and is not capable of identifying mold.\\

This home inspection constitutes a non-intrusive, visual assessment of the readily accessible portions of the property. Its purpose is to identify significant concerns within specific systems or components as observed and deemed relevant by the inspector at the precise date and time of the inspection. All recommendations pertaining to repair, replacement, further evaluation, or maintenance should be reviewed by qualified trade professionals within your contractual contingency period or prior to the closing date, as applicable. This is essential for obtaining accurate cost estimates for any necessary work and recognizing that these expert evaluations may uncover additional issues beyond what is discernible during a purely visual inspection. This report will not encompass every conceivable issue or defect present but focuses solely on material deficiencies that were visible on the day of the assessment. The inspection aims solely to aid in evaluating the general condition of the residence. It does not forecast future conditions, and the property\&apos;s state may evolve immediately following our departure. Inspectors are not obligated to relocate personal belongings, access panels, furnishings, equipment, vegetation, earth, snow, ice, or any obstructions that impede access or visibility.\\

It is advisable to review the established Standards of Practice for a comprehensive understanding of the inspection\&apos;s scope.
The findings in this report reflect the observable condition of the property\&apos;s accessible areas solely on the inspection date. The state of components can fluctuate between the inspection date and the date of title transfer. A comprehensive final walkthrough before closing is strongly advised to mitigate unforeseen issues. Acquiring a home warranty is also recommended, particularly if certain systems are approaching or have exceeded their expected lifespan.
Notice to Third Parties: This document is the proprietary information of the inspection company and is exclusively for the client(s) named herein. It is not transferable to any other parties or future purchasers. This inspection and report are conducted under a specific contractual agreement that defines its scope and utility. Therefore, any unauthorized individuals or entities are cautioned against relying on this report and should instead engage their own qualified property inspector to obtain an independent assessment.
Copyright Notice: This report is the intellectual property of the inspection firm. The client(s) and their designated real estate representative mentioned herein are the sole authorized licensees of this document. This report, in its entirety or in part, is strictly non-transferable to any third parties, including but not limited to subsequent buyers, sellers, or listing agents. The reproduction of identified deficiencies for the purpose of preparing repair requests is permissible. THE CONTENTS OF THIS REPORT ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR THE RELIANCE OF THE CLIENT NAMED HEREIN. This report is subject to an inspection agreement that outlines its scope, limitations, exclusions, and copyright terms. Unapproved recipients are advised to commission a separate inspection from a qualified professional of their choosing.
For clarity within this report, all directional references such as left, right, rear, and front are established from the perspective of facing the primary entrance of the structure, as illustrated in the cover photograph.\\

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{PURPOSE OF INSPECTION}
A real estate inspection is a visual survey of a structure and a basic performance evaluation of the systems and components of a building. It provides information regarding the general condition of a residence at the time the inspection was conducted.

It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information. Ask the inspector to clarify any items or comments that are unclear.

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSPECTOR}
This inspection is governed by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) Standards of Practice (SOPs), which dictates the minimum requirements for a real estate inspection.

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item use this Property Inspection Report form for the inspection;
\item inspect only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at the time of the inspection;
\item indicate whether each item was inspected, not inspected, or not present;
\item indicate an item as Deficient (D) if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a system or component OR constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the SOPs; and
\item explain the inspector's findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS NOT required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item identify all potential hazards;
\item turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utilities, or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance;
\item climb over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items;
\item prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another;
\item provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs have been made; or
\item inspect system or component listed under the optional section of the SOPs (22 TAC 535.233).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLIENT}
While items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions, in the event that any further evaluations are needed, it is the responsibility of the client to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service professionals regarding any items reported as Deficient (D). It is recommended that any further evaluations and/or cost estimates take place prior to the expiration of any contractual time limitations, such as option periods.

\noindent\textbf{Please Note:} Evaluations performed by service professionals in response to items reported as Deficient (D) on the report may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies that were not present, visible, or accessible at the time of the inspection. Any repairs made after the date of the inspection may render information contained in this report obsolete or invalid.

\subsection*{NOTICE CONCERNING HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS, DEFICIENCIES, AND CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS}

Conditions may be present in your home that did not violate building codes or common practices in effect when the home was constructed but are considered hazardous by today's standards. Such conditions that were part of the home prior to the adoption of any current codes prohibiting them may not be required to be updated to meet current code requirements. However, if it can be reasonably determined that they are present at the time of the inspection, the potential for injury or property loss from these conditions is significant enough to require inspectors to report them as Deficient (D). Examples of such hazardous conditions include:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item malfunctioning, improperly installed, or missing ground fault circuit protection (GFCI) devices and arc-fault (AFCI) devices;
\item ordinary glass in locations where modern construction techniques call for safety glass;
\item malfunctioning or lack of fire safety features such as smoke alarms, fire-rated doors in certain locations, and functional emergency escape and rescue openings in bedrooms;
\item malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarms;
\item excessive spacing between balusters on stairways and porches;
\item improperly installed appliances;
\item improperly installed or defective safety devices;
\item lack of electrical bonding and grounding; and
\item lack of bonding on gas piping, including corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST).
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Please Note:} items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions. The decision to correct a hazard or any deficiency identified in an inspection report is left up to the parties to the contract for the sale or purchase of the home.

This property inspection report may include an inspection agreement (contract), addenda, and other information related to property conditions.

\subsection*{PURPOSE OF INSPECTION}
A real estate inspection is a visual survey of a structure and a basic performance evaluation of the systems and components of a building. It provides information regarding the general condition of a residence at the time the inspection was conducted.

It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information. Ask the inspector to clarify any items or comments that are unclear.

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSPECTOR}
This inspection is governed by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) Standards of Practice (SOPs), which dictates the minimum requirements for a real estate inspection.

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item use this Property Inspection Report form for the inspection;
\item inspect only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at the time of the inspection;
\item indicate whether each item was inspected, not inspected, or not present;
\item indicate an item as Deficient (D) if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a system or component OR constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the SOPs; and
\item explain the inspector's findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{The inspector IS NOT required to:}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\item identify all potential hazards;
\item turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utilities, or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance;
\item climb over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items;
\item prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another;
\item provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs have been made; or
\item inspect system or component listed under the optional section of the SOPs (22 TAC 535.233).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLIENT}
While items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions, in the event that any further evaluations are needed, it is the responsibility of the client to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service professionals regarding any items reported as Deficient (D). It is recommended that any further evaluations and/or cost estimates take place prior to the expiration of any contractual time limitations, such as option periods.

\noindent\textbf{Please Note:} Evaluations performed by service professionals in response to items reported as Deficient (D) on the report may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies that were not present, visible, or accessible at the time of the inspection. Any repairs made after the date of the inspection may render information contained in this report obsolete or invalid.

\section*{\centering I. INSPECTION REPORT OVERVIEW}

\subsection*{A. Report Context}

Please be advised that infrared thermal imaging may be utilized to assess specific areas or systems for potential anomalies. Any indications observed through thermal imaging are always corroborated by supplementary methods, such as a moisture meter, to confirm their presence. The effectiveness of infrared thermography in detecting moisture is contingent upon the actual presence of moisture; therefore, during dry periods, a leak may exist but remain undetectable if the affected materials are devoid of moisture. It is crucial to understand that thermal imaging does not function as X-ray vision, cannot penetrate solid surfaces, and is not capable of identifying mold.\\

This home inspection constitutes a non-intrusive, visual assessment of the readily accessible portions of the property. Its purpose is to identify significant concerns within specific systems or components as observed and deemed relevant by the inspector at the precise date and time of the inspection. All recommendations pertaining to repair, replacement, further evaluation, or maintenance should be reviewed by qualified trade professionals within your contractual contingency period or prior to the closing date, as applicable. This is essential for obtaining accurate cost estimates for any necessary work and recognizing that these expert evaluations may uncover additional issues beyond what is discernible during a purely visual inspection. This report will not encompass every conceivable issue or defect present but focuses solely on material deficiencies that were visible on the day of the assessment. The inspection aims solely to aid in evaluating the general condition of the residence. It does not forecast future conditions, and the property\&apos;s state may evolve immediately following our departure. Inspectors are not obligated to relocate personal belongings, access panels, furnishings, equipment, vegetation, earth, snow, ice, or any obstructions that impede access or visibility.\\

It is advisable to review the established Standards of Practice for a comprehensive understanding of the inspection\&apos;s scope.
The findings in this report reflect the observable condition of the property\&apos;s accessible areas solely on the inspection date. The state of components can fluctuate between the inspection date and the date of title transfer. A comprehensive final walkthrough before closing is strongly advised to mitigate unforeseen issues. Acquiring a home warranty is also recommended, particularly if certain systems are approaching or have exceeded their expected lifespan.
Notice to Third Parties: This document is the proprietary information of the inspection company and is exclusively for the client(s) named herein. It is not transferable to any other parties or future purchasers. This inspection and report are conducted under a specific contractual agreement that defines its scope and utility. Therefore, any unauthorized individuals or entities are cautioned against relying on this report and should instead engage their own qualified property inspector to obtain an independent assessment.

This report is subject to an inspection agreement that outlines its scope, limitations, exclusions, and copyright terms. Unapproved recipients are advised to commission a separate inspection from a qualified professional of their choosing.
